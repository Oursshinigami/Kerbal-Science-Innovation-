Hello, I m Ourshinigami.

I would like know what you think about KSI (Kerbal science Innovation) ? 
If you can write a comment on my Forum Thread so as to know what you think about my mod and what I need to change.
Link : http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/162706-wip-kerbal-science-innovation/

If you want, you can propose an Idea of a science part of today where a science part of the future (If it is possible, science  part of the future).

I hope what you could take your own time so as to reade this litle text.

Thanks and have a great day and good game in Kerbal Space Programme
